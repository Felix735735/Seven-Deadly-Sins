# Seven-Deadly-Sins
Hey! in this github it will show the .apk file and the decompiled apk. Currently because grand cross is a server-based game, we can't hack the the currency and etc.
But we are working on a way t be able to not hack the server, but hack it at the same time. One of the ideas is to emulate the game server.
